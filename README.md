# Urban Mobility Sandbox - A Case Study of NYC Subway Recovery After COVID-19

This project aims to understand how special events influence human mobility in urban settings. By modeling the volume and recovery pattern of subway ridership with high spatial-temporal resolution demographic, traffic, and urban planning datasets, the project produces an interpretable template for mobility modeling tasks.

This corresponding code repository contains the computational notebooks to collect, clean, and analyze the urban datasets discussed in the paper. The notebooks can be uploaded to Google Colab and library installations are handled within the notebook.
